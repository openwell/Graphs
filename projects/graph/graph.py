    # COMPARISON	STACK	                     QUEUE
# Working principle	LIFO (Last in First out)	FIFO (First in First out)
# Structure	Same end is used to insert and delete elements.	One end is used for insertion, i.e., rear end and another end is used for deletion of elements, i.e., front end.
# Number of pointers used	One	                Two (In simple queue case)
# Operations performed	Push and Pop	        Enqueue and dequeue
# Examination of empty condition	Top == -1	Front == -1 || Front == Rear + 1
# Examination of full condition
# Top == Max - 1	                            Rear == Max - 1
# Variants	It does not have variants.	        It has variants like circular queue, priority queue, doubly ended queue.
# Implementation	                            Simpler	Comparatively complex
